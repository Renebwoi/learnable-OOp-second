<h1 style= "color: yellow" > About this task </h1>

This task is designed to cover all applications of the four major properties of classes.

For <b>Abstraction</b>, The workings of the movement method is not of concern to the user.

For <b>Encapsulation</b>,The variable name cannot be accessed directly from the Animalia class. The movement method cannot be accessed from the parent animalia class.

For <b>Inheritance</b>, the other classes inherit the properties and values of the parent Animalia class.

for <b>Polymorphism</b> (method overiding), the movement method is changed according to the properties of each sub-class

## How it works

A new object is created everytime the sub classes are called. The methods are initiated based on the sub class called. The available method is walking for now.
